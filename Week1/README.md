**REPOSITORY GUIDELINES**

*Week 1*

1. Go to shell, and navigate to Week1 folder: `cd Week1`
2. Compile java file: `javac WordCounter.java`
3. Run java file: `java WordCounter ../pride-and-prejudice.txt`

Note: for week 1, I accidentally moved some stuff while copy and pasting to week 2, so the time-stamp might show a later time-stamp, but I hope you trust me that I didn't make any changes haha. You can check the time-stamp on the WordCounter.class for proof. Thanks!

*General:*

1. Files for respective weeks can be found in WeekX directory, where X = week of project. 
2. Text files are in parent directory and are referenced in the Java code as such.
3. Main.java file in parent directory serves no purpose.
