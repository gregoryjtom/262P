**Week 7 Assignment**

*To run the assignments:*

1. Go to shell, and navigate to Week7 folder: `cd Week7`
2. Compile java file of interest: `javac Number.java`
3. Run java file: `java Number ../pride-and-prejudice.txt`

*For 21 and 22:*

- Running the program with an error will print out the entire stack trace (however, for 21 the program still continues and prints out a message at the end).
- Some ways to test the errors are:
  - running without command line argument (will still print out answer for 21)
  - running with a fake file name
